1
00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:21.309
I'm Eep. Of the Croods clan.

2
00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:25.983
Gotcha!

3
00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:30.528
And I'm on the hunt.

4
00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:32.424
But not for food.

5
00:00:32.448 --> 00:00:34.579
That's old Eep. I'm new Eep.

6
00:00:38.287 --> 00:00:39.578
Whoo!

7
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.710
Ha!

8
00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.677
And new Eep just needs a pen.

9
00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:24.769
‐ Dear Bark Journal,

10
00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.855
so what put the new in new me?

11
00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:29.231
I'm glad I asked myself that question.

12
00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:30.567
I was walking with my family,

13
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:32.236
my dad Grug, my mom Ugga,

14
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.236
my little brother Thunk,
my little sister Sandy,

15
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.030
my gran Gran, and Guy,

16
00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:39.366
as in my guy,
the guy of my dreams but real.

17
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.409
And we hit a wall.

18
00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:41.870
So, of course, Dad smashed through it.

19
00:01:41.894 --> 00:01:43.331
And there was a farm and a tree house.

20
00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:46.128
And a family, the Bettermans,
Phil, Hope and their daughter Dawn.

21
00:01:46.152 --> 00:01:48.688
They weren't happy about their wall,
and we didn't get along.

22
00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.337
But then we were attacked
by these crazy punch monkeys

23
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.677
so we had to team up to survive.

24
00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:55.549
It went so well,
the Bettermans invited us to move in,

25
00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:57.509
and, boom, first neighborhood ever!

26
00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:59.311
And, boom, again, first best friend ever!

27
00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:00.346
Dawn rocks!

28
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.555
But the punch monkeys don't,

29
00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.016
so welcome back, wall,
and hello, peace and quiet.

30
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.269
Yep, the Croods are livin' easy now.

31
00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:08.133
Except it's not so easy.

32
00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:13.943
‐ Is it night yet?

33
00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.903
‐ No, honey, we just woke up.

34
00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:17.530
‐ Aw, come on!

35
00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:20.115
No hunting, no chasing.

36
00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.349
‐ No fighting.

37
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.206
‐ Sorry, Sandy.

38
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.373
Nothing to fight here.

39
00:02:25.397 --> 00:02:27.831
The farm has food, shelter, and safety.

40
00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:29.709
It's comfortable, predictable‐‐

41
00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:32.461
‐ And so‐o‐o‐o boring!

42
00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.379
‐ Relaxing?

43
00:02:34.403 --> 00:02:36.174
Good. Keep doing that.

44
00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:37.800
‐ Can we help with anything, Hope?

45
00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.177
‐ Nope. Everything's taken care of.

46
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:42.096
Ew!

47
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.973
So I'll make lunch

48
00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.599
and you stay out of the way
and do nothing.

49
00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:46.441
Bye!

50
00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:47.811
‐ Do nothing?

51
00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:49.020
We're the Croods!

52
00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:50.570
We hunt Kangadillos.

53
00:02:50.594 --> 00:02:52.147
We topple trees.

54
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.027
We paint the things we do on rocks.

55
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:56.069
We gotta have a purpose on this farm.

56
00:02:56.093 --> 00:02:59.579
Because, if we don't,
we're as useless as a slugopotamus.

57
00:02:59.603 --> 00:03:02.282
And the Croods aren't slugopotomuses.

58
00:03:02.306 --> 00:03:03.454
‐ As far as we know.

59
00:03:03.478 --> 00:03:05.703
‐ Is doing nothing really so bad?

60
00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.227
Look how happy Douglas is.

61
00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:11.209
See? I've always said moving is overrated.

62
00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:14.920
Oh, uh, could someone
move my cup closer to my mouth?

63
00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:16.256
‐ Thunk's right.

64
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.716
Down time has an upside.

65
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.118
More time for stolen kisses.

66
00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.579
‐ Morning, Guy.

67
00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.936
‐ More time for careless whispers. Whoops.

68
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.896
‐ Hmm. More time for cuddling.

69
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.438
‐ No. No time for cuddling.

70
00:03:33.462 --> 00:03:34.949
‐ Wh... What about the sleep pile?

71
00:03:34.973 --> 00:03:36.795
We did that every night in our old life.

72
00:03:40.012 --> 00:03:41.322
‐ That's family cuddling.

73
00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.448
It's completely different.

74
00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:45.826
‐ Fine. New Eep and Guy
can cuddle with our eyes.

75
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.203
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

76
00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.329
‐ Hey!

77
00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:50.612
‐ Hey! Something to do just ran by.

78
00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.000
Mom's right.

79
00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:53.170
Pigator on the loose.

80
00:03:53.194 --> 00:03:55.377
‐ Let's grab it and stab it!

81
00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:59.389
‐ Or, we can redirect that stabbing energy
into something less stabby.

82
00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:03.195
‐ Uh, I'm still waiting for someone
to move my cup. Yeah.

83
00:04:29.728 --> 00:04:30.728
‐ Ooh!

84
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:33.917
‐ Aw!

85
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:34.798
Morning, Phil.

86
00:04:34.822 --> 00:04:35.834
‐ Good morning.

87
00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:37.670
Just testing my new trap.

88
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.130
So no more runaway pigators.

89
00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:42.050
‐ But we were gonna catch that pigator.

90
00:04:42.074 --> 00:04:44.343
‐ No need. This trap is flawless.

91
00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.678
Just like the rest of the system
that runs this farm.

92
00:04:46.702 --> 00:04:49.139
So keep doing nothing, Croods.

93
00:04:49.163 --> 00:04:50.766
It suits you.

94
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.437
‐ What was that?

95
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:53.185
‐ Oh, that's a bounceberry.

96
00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.776
They're ripe. It's time to harvest them.

97
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.064
‐ Ooh! Uh, we'll do that!

98
00:04:56.088 --> 00:04:57.606
‐ Oh, I don't think so.

99
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.196
Bounceberries are a favorite fruit
around here.

100
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.778
And they can be tricky. Even dangerous.

101
00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.786
‐ Great! We love danger. We're in.

102
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.406
‐ You're out. It's taken care of.

103
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.785
‐ Uh, let me guess. By the system?

104
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.370
‐ Precisely. With me at the helm.

105
00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:15.083
So, if you'll excuse me,
I need to limber up before the harvest.

106
00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:17.817
Time for a steam in the man cave.

107
00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:20.673
‐ Come on.

108
00:05:20.697 --> 00:05:23.216
There has to be something
we can do around here

109
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.218
‐ You know who has ideas?

110
00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:27.678
Guy‐Boy, I can hear those wheels turning.

111
00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.180
‐ You get one pet name a day.

112
00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:30.889
So that's it. You're done.

113
00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:34.060
‐ Well, one idea is both sides compromise
and live in peace.

114
00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:35.769
‐ Ha. That'll never work.

115
00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:38.108
‐ You just need
something to do to be happy.

116
00:05:38.132 --> 00:05:40.235
But it doesn't have to be work, right?

117
00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:41.358
So, how about a game?

118
00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:42.656
Ooh. How about this,

119
00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.966
you find something
and then you throw it?

120
00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.134
It's called "Throw."

121
00:05:51.268 --> 00:05:53.124
Yeah. Throw might need some work.

122
00:05:53.148 --> 00:05:54.204
‐ Better idea,

123
00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:56.165
we stop doing
what Phil and Hope tell us to do

124
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.959
and we start doing
what we wanna do.

125
00:05:57.983 --> 00:05:59.209
Because this is our home now.

126
00:05:59.233 --> 00:05:59.880
‐ Yes.

127
00:05:59.904 --> 00:06:02.088
‐ Grug, go tell Phil
that's what's happening.

128
00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.673
‐ Aw, in the steam?

129
00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:06.134
‐ Yes. And I'll tell Hope
I'm gonna help her.

130
00:06:06.158 --> 00:06:07.218
Whether she likes it or not.

131
00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:08.720
‐ Dawn will love this.

132
00:06:08.744 --> 00:06:11.348
Her whole life, her parents have been
so worried about her getting hurt,

133
00:06:11.372 --> 00:06:12.937
they've never let her do anything.

134
00:06:12.961 --> 00:06:14.350
Let's go, Guy‐baby.

135
00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.713
‐ One pet name a day. That's two.

136
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.862
‐ You're always welcome
in my man cave, Grug.

137
00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:28.281
My steam is your steam.

138
00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:29.531
‐ Uh, yeah, thanks.

139
00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.225
So I'm here to tell you‐‐

140
00:06:36.103 --> 00:06:37.153
So I'm here to‐‐

141
00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:48.367
I'm here to tell you things‐‐

142
00:06:49.201 --> 00:06:50.720
are going to change around here.

143
00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:51.930
‐ Of course.

144
00:06:51.954 --> 00:06:53.437
Let's talk about that.

145
00:06:53.461 --> 00:06:55.057
‐ Great, so we're gonna‐‐

146
00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:56.600
‐ After the steam.

147
00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:57.935
‐ Right, but‐but Ugga said‐‐

148
00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.646
‐ Steam first, talk after.

149
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.146
‐ Okay, but, uh, I'm‐‐

150
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.024
‐ Steam, then talk.

151
00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:03.565
‐ But‐‐

152
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.629
‐ Steam, talk.

153
00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.507
‐ Well, how long of a steam?

154
00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:11.492
Phil?

155
00:07:11.516 --> 00:07:13.283
Phil? Phil?

156
00:07:13.307 --> 00:07:14.786
Phil, where'd you go? Phil!

157
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.889
‐ Yes?

158
00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:23.356
See? You're completely relaxed,
thanks to the steam.

159
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:27.339
‐ So sweet of you to offer.

160
00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:29.384
But I'm making lunch. Okay?

161
00:07:29.408 --> 00:07:31.970
‐ No. We're making lunch. Together.

162
00:07:31.994 --> 00:07:35.139
‐ Ohh. You wanna help make lunch?

163
00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:36.057
In my kitchen?

164
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:37.081
‐ Our kitchen.

165
00:07:38.834 --> 00:07:41.228
‐ Of course. Our kitchen.

166
00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:42.689
Because you live here now.

167
00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:45.441
So we share the kitchen,
that was once mine. Good.

168
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:46.584
‐ I'm glad you're not upset.

169
00:07:47.968 --> 00:07:48.944
‐ Upset?

170
00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.904
In the kitchen I helped build from nothing

171
00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:53.449
that I never had to share with
anyone before now?

172
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.312
How could I be upset? That's crazy.

173
00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.704
‐ We're cooking meat, right?

174
00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.583
Because that's all I eat. Meat.

175
00:08:01.607 --> 00:08:03.834
‐ Oh, good. More help.

176
00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.336
Well, we're making soup, so‐‐

177
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.911
‐ Soup? You got it.

178
00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:16.180
‐ So you don't know what soup is.

179
00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.245
‐ Nope.

180
00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:21.667
‐ Ew.

181
00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:25.959
‐ You're saying we're gonna
do something around here?

182
00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:28.487
But my parents
don't want me doing anything.

183
00:08:28.512 --> 00:08:30.069
Even playing Throw like this.

184
00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:31.069
'Cause they think I'll die.

185
00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:32.826
‐ I'm so glad you guys like Throw.

186
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.407
‐ Forget your parents.

187
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:36.311
Because we're not gonna do anything.

188
00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.037
We're gonna do everything.

189
00:08:39.061 --> 00:08:40.663
Whoa, game changer.

190
00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:43.457
You're saying I could eat
breakfast for dinner?

191
00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:45.505
I could get dirty and stay dirty?

192
00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:47.211
I could tell my parents what to do?

193
00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:49.254
‐ Exactly. And that's just the start.

194
00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:50.756
‐ Breakfast‐dinner? The best.

195
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.216
Dirt? Never gets old.

196
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.469
But I think your parents
like to be in charge.

197
00:08:54.493 --> 00:08:56.929
It's their thing.
So maybe we start smaller.

198
00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:57.770
‐ Smaller how?

199
00:08:57.794 --> 00:09:01.100
‐ Well, what if we added
something to Throw, like catching?

200
00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.856
Ooh! We could call it Catch.

201
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.980
‐ Hey, uh, could one of you
move my cup closer to my mouth?

202
00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:07.606
‐ Or you could just get your cup.

203
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.567
‐ Are you nuts?

204
00:09:08.591 --> 00:09:10.657
It's all the way across the farm
by my hammock.

205
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:12.966
‐ Thunk, wanna play Catch? Catch.

206
00:09:14.428 --> 00:09:16.825
‐ Or we go bigger. Bigger like a‐‐

207
00:09:16.849 --> 00:09:18.909
Bounceberry.

208
00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:20.563
Let's bounce!

209
00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:32.756
‐ Lunch is served.

210
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.388
‐ Which is what I used to say
because I always served lunch.

211
00:09:36.412 --> 00:09:37.678
But now Ugga's doing it.

212
00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:39.268
And I'm fine with that.

213
00:09:39.292 --> 00:09:40.889
Because I have to be.

214
00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:41.963
Or do I?

215
00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:45.644
‐ Wh‐‐ What? Why would you‐‐

216
00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.605
‐ Oops. Ugga spilled the soup.

217
00:09:47.629 --> 00:09:50.316
But don't worry, I'll make a new lunch.

218
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.609
‐ We'll make a new lunch.

219
00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:53.393
‐ Perfect.

220
00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:56.697
‐ At least they have
something to do. Lucky.

221
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.198
Well, so do we.

222
00:09:58.222 --> 00:09:59.200
Bounceberries.

223
00:09:59.224 --> 00:09:59.908
‐ Bounceberries?

224
00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:00.830
‐ Bounceberries!

225
00:10:00.854 --> 00:10:02.061
‐ Bananas!

226
00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:04.121
We're saying fruits, right?

227
00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:06.291
‐ Uh, no. Bounceberries.

228
00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:07.708
We're gonna help you harvest them.

229
00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:11.129
‐ And you will not... uh, stop me?

230
00:10:11.153 --> 00:10:12.379
‐ Strong start, Dawn. Keep going.

231
00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:15.413
‐ Because, you don't... own me!

232
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:17.759
‐ Comin' in a little hot, Dawn.

233
00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:19.052
‐ Let's do this.

234
00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:21.597
I know nothing about bounceberries
but they're my jam.

235
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.229
Ooh, bounceberry jam.

236
00:10:23.253 --> 00:10:24.433
Great idea.

237
00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.518
We'll make it together, Hope.

238
00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:26.399
‐ Sure.

239
00:10:26.423 --> 00:10:28.480
First lunch, then bounceberry jam.

240
00:10:28.504 --> 00:10:31.816
In fact, why don't you just
make a to‐do leaf for us?

241
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.429
‐ Already done. Here you go.

242
00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:37.905
‐ So it's settled.

243
00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.537
We'll all harvest
the bounceberries together?

244
00:10:39.561 --> 00:10:42.576
‐ Done deal! Bounceberries! Boom!

245
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.328
‐ You're heating up
instead of cooling down, Dawn.

246
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:47.789
‐ I'm sorry, Croods,
but we have a system here.

247
00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:50.010
And, if you disrupt it,
there could be chaos.

248
00:10:50.034 --> 00:10:51.485
‐ Works for me.

249
00:10:54.947 --> 00:10:57.383
‐ Ugh. You keep saying system.

250
00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:58.407
What system?

251
00:11:00.619 --> 00:11:04.807
‐ I spent years creating
an intricate system to run our farm.

252
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:05.937
Don't touch the system.

253
00:11:05.961 --> 00:11:09.062
Our food, our water,
even our cooling breezes

254
00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:11.688
are made possible by the system.

255
00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:13.774
I said, don't touch the system.

256
00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:15.610
"Don't" is the key word.

257
00:11:15.634 --> 00:11:19.322
For example, these vines
gently gather chicken seal eggs

258
00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:23.243
and carry them to baskets
without cracking a single egg.

259
00:11:23.267 --> 00:11:25.517
It's a flawless system.

260
00:11:29.398 --> 00:11:30.977
Ugh!

261
00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:36.004
Which is why I said... don't touch it.

262
00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:37.465
Whew. There you are.

263
00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:39.424
I've been looking
all over the farm for you guys.

264
00:11:39.448 --> 00:11:42.578
Hey, uh, could someone please
move my cup closer to my‐‐

265
00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.650
‐ If your system's so great,
why did it break?

266
00:11:51.674 --> 00:11:53.940
‐ Yeah, we don't break.

267
00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.899
Guess we're better than your system.

268
00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:57.974
‐ You? Better than my system?

269
00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:00.864
Preposterous.

270
00:12:00.888 --> 00:12:03.283
‐ Try us. On the bounceberries.

271
00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:04.702
‐ Eep can do it, Phil.

272
00:12:04.726 --> 00:12:06.870
When she goes after something,
she gets it.

273
00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:07.903
Like my heart.

274
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.296
‐ Well, unlike your heart,
I can't risk the bounceberry harvest.

275
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.215
They're too delicious to squander.

276
00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:19.506
So only the Bettermans
can tame the bouncy beast.

277
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.049
‐ What? We hate doing it.

278
00:12:21.073 --> 00:12:22.971
We only do it because we have no choice.

279
00:12:22.995 --> 00:12:25.429
And you almost die during every harvest.

280
00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.764
Oh, no!

281
00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.207
No, no, no!

282
00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:31.019
Help! They're gonna get me!

283
00:12:31.043 --> 00:12:32.769
‐ This year we have a choice.

284
00:12:32.793 --> 00:12:35.940
The Croods wanna help, so let them.

285
00:12:35.963 --> 00:12:36.947
‐ You're right.

286
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:39.777
Why stand in the way
of the Croods' happiness?

287
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:42.697
Besides, what's the worst
that could happen?

288
00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:44.260
Ugh.

289
00:12:45.057 --> 00:12:47.517
‐ Boy, those eggs
were really up there, huh?

290
00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:50.496
‐ Bounceberries, they may look fun,

291
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.456
but they're not.

292
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.586
‐ Because they're heavy?

293
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.750
No problem.
‐ No.

294
00:12:53.774 --> 00:12:55.501
‐ Poisonous?
‐ Seriously?

295
00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.294
They're called bounceberries.

296
00:12:57.318 --> 00:12:58.448
‐ Right.

297
00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:00.633
So they stink.

298
00:13:00.657 --> 00:13:01.466
‐ So close.

299
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.966
But I think they bounce.

300
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.638
Because bounce‐berries.

301
00:13:04.662 --> 00:13:06.221
Ohh!

302
00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:08.014
‐ And they're hard to catch

303
00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:09.515
because the moment they leave the bush,

304
00:13:09.539 --> 00:13:11.058
they bounce for the hills.

305
00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:12.293
‐ No problem.

306
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.106
Eep, Guy, you run point
and drive the berries forward.

307
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.943
Gran, Sandy, you're in the wings.

308
00:13:17.967 --> 00:13:19.984
And you'll all herd the berries
to this point here

309
00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:21.403
so Ugga and I can catch them.

310
00:13:21.427 --> 00:13:23.363
‐ What about me? What's my job?

311
00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:26.407
‐ Oh, Dawn. This is too dangerous for you.

312
00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:29.744
You could get bruised.
Or bumped. Or tired.

313
00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:31.745
You can watch from behind that rock.

314
00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:34.706
‐ No. You can't make me
watch my life anymore.

315
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.110
'Cause now I'm gonna live it!

316
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.798
I‐I mean, if that's okay with you, Mom.

317
00:13:41.822 --> 00:13:43.258
‐ Nice heat adjustment, Dawn.

318
00:13:43.282 --> 00:13:46.349
‐ Very well, let's do a trial run
with a few bushes.

319
00:13:46.373 --> 00:13:48.136
A dry bounce, if you will.

320
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:49.517
But first, some rules.

321
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.144
Rule number one, do not eat
the bounceberries when harvesting them.

322
00:13:53.168 --> 00:13:54.875
Here's why‐‐

323
00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:58.955
Go!

324
00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:06.947
Ha!

325
00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.448
‐ Wanna bounce, Guy‐lyface?

326
00:14:08.472 --> 00:14:10.077
‐ Only if I'm bouncing with you, Eepykins.

327
00:14:10.101 --> 00:14:10.706
Ooh!

328
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:12.202
‐ That's three pet names today!

329
00:14:12.226 --> 00:14:13.203
Three!

330
00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:14.648
Way too many.

331
00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:25.072
Focus!

332
00:14:31.038 --> 00:14:33.394
‐ That's not harvesting.
That's frolicking.

333
00:14:33.418 --> 00:14:36.335
‐ If you're enjoying it,
you're doing it wrong.

334
00:14:52.267 --> 00:14:56.038
‐ My dad was right.
This is just like a kangadillo chase!

335
00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:58.875
‐ Even better,
everyone's cooperating and happy‐‐

336
00:14:58.899 --> 00:14:59.667
Aah!

337
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:00.710
Except me.

338
00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:03.587
‐ Your head looks like a bounceberry.

339
00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.412
Yah!

340
00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:10.427
‐ Oh, no! Where are Mom and Dad?

341
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:13.961
‐ They're MIA! Sandy, break those berries.

342
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.562
I got this one!

343
00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:22.417
No, I don't!

344
00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:24.734
Dawn!

345
00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.008
Whoa!

346
00:15:26.844 --> 00:15:28.803
‐ Never fear. I'll catch you.

347
00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:32.491
Sorry, Dad!

348
00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:33.885
‐ Nice catch, Phil.

349
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.538
‐ Sorry, Mom!

350
00:15:36.562 --> 00:15:39.499
‐ Oh, no! I think these bounceberries
are going for a swim.

351
00:15:39.523 --> 00:15:41.153
‐ Oh, no, they're not.

352
00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:50.346
‐ Who wants bounceberries?

353
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.076
‐ I do. Eat up, gang.

354
00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:57.284
Mm! Mm!

355
00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.397
No!

356
00:15:59.421 --> 00:16:01.748
I told you not to eat them.

357
00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:06.067
‐ Why not? We caught it. We eat it.

358
00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:09.445
‐ Right. Also, sticky.

359
00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.614
Woo‐hoo!
‐ No!

360
00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:12.490
‐ Whoo!

361
00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:13.783
I'm alive!

362
00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.869
And stuck.

363
00:16:15.893 --> 00:16:16.750
‐ Ugh.

364
00:16:16.774 --> 00:16:18.328
‐ I don't mind being stuck.

365
00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:19.210
I mind.

366
00:16:19.234 --> 00:16:20.649
Stop sticking!

367
00:16:21.565 --> 00:16:22.815
No, no, no, Sandy, don't‐‐

368
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.086
Uh... never mind, sweetie.

369
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.590
‐ That's why you can't eat them
during the harvest.

370
00:16:28.614 --> 00:16:30.924
The berry juice makes you sticky.

371
00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:34.011
And when you're sticky,
you can't harvest berries.

372
00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:35.036
Just ask Hope.

373
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:40.309
‐ Yep.

374
00:16:40.334 --> 00:16:41.607
I learned the hard way.

375
00:16:41.631 --> 00:16:43.523
And I guess I get to do it again this year

376
00:16:43.547 --> 00:16:47.024
on top of completely losing control
of everything in my life!

377
00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:50.068
‐ So, now that you're all too sticky
to finish the harvest,

378
00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:52.830
we have to find another solution
so we don't have to do it.

379
00:16:52.854 --> 00:16:55.240
‐ Huh? Huh? What about us?

380
00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:56.951
They just left us.

381
00:16:56.975 --> 00:16:59.037
‐ You think that's bad?
I'm their daughter.

382
00:16:59.061 --> 00:17:01.331
‐ Don't worry. I'll get us free.

383
00:17:01.355 --> 00:17:03.315
Just need to use some muscle.

384
00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:06.275
Or a lot of muscle.

385
00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:10.256
‐ Or we wait for them to come back.

386
00:17:10.279 --> 00:17:12.467
‐ Hang tight! I'll kick you loose.

387
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.080
‐ No! Anything but your‐‐

388
00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:18.080
‐ Guy, get your face off my feet.

389
00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:21.791
‐ It's okay, guys. Thunk'll save us.

390
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.938
That's good.

391
00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:28.011
‐ Cup... too far.

392
00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:31.365
‐ They're not coming back.

393
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.030
‐ It's fine. Because we're going to
pull ourselves apart on three.

394
00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:36.031
Ready?

395
00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:37.766
One‐‐ ‐ For freedom!

396
00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:49.008
‐ That didn't work.
But it did bring us closer together.

397
00:17:49.031 --> 00:17:52.173
So close, it's hard to imagine
being apart from you.

398
00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:54.509
‐ Oh, Guy. You're so romantic.

399
00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:56.426
‐ No. No romance.

400
00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:57.636
We're stuck here forever.

401
00:17:57.661 --> 00:17:59.861
We need to decide which one of us
we're gonna eat first.

402
00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:02.558
Ha‐ha! I knew you'd come back.

403
00:18:02.583 --> 00:18:04.356
Didn't doubt it for a second.

404
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:05.894
You‐you can get us free, right?

405
00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.313
For freedom!

406
00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:09.297
‐ Of course. All it takes is water.

407
00:18:11.884 --> 00:18:13.611
‐ Water? That's it?

408
00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:15.404
Why didn't you free us right away then?

409
00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:18.157
‐ Free you? When the bounceberries
are ready to be harvested?

410
00:18:18.182 --> 00:18:19.618
One must have priorities.

411
00:18:19.643 --> 00:18:23.375
‐ And priority number one
is making sure we don't have to do it.

412
00:18:23.398 --> 00:18:26.624
‐ Yes, as we recently established,
I don't enjoy it.

413
00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:28.585
And you don't follow directions.

414
00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.752
But now it's in good hands.

415
00:18:30.777 --> 00:18:32.255
Or should I say fists?

416
00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:33.608
‐ Why would you say fists?

417
00:18:37.159 --> 00:18:38.510
Punch monkeys?

418
00:18:38.535 --> 00:18:39.304
‐ Not good.

419
00:18:39.327 --> 00:18:42.933
‐ Why? Because punch monkeys
do nothing but punch, steal, lie, destroy

420
00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.268
and generally make our lives
more difficult in every way?

421
00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.394
‐ True, we've had our differences.

422
00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:48.395
But that's history.

423
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.106
They're strong, fast,
they've got big hands,

424
00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:52.421
and unlike you, they listen.

425
00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:57.363
So I asked them to give us a fist
and they said yes.

426
00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:59.199
‐ But this was our job.

427
00:18:59.222 --> 00:19:01.784
‐ And now it's not. Isn't that great?

428
00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:04.496
‐ No! This was our purpose.

429
00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:06.538
It was gonna save us from being useless.

430
00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:07.789
Like a slugopotamus.

431
00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.541
‐ And I'm no slugopotamus.

432
00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:12.377
‐ No, you're like
a beautiful meteor shower.

433
00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:13.546
But on the ground.

434
00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:14.967
‐ Comin' in a little hot, Guy.
‐ Okay.

435
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:18.175
‐ And you have a lot to learn
about meteor showers.

436
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.721
Now, gawk as the punch monkeys
do what you couldn't,

437
00:19:22.746 --> 00:19:24.265
finish the harvest.

438
00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:26.435
And for a mere one banana per monkey.

439
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.788
‐ Someone should tell them that.

440
00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:32.545
‐ What are you doing? Stop!

441
00:19:34.383 --> 00:19:36.318
Huh. I don't understand that punch.

442
00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.695
Uh, Guy, you speak
better punch monkey than I do.

443
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.404
What did he say?

444
00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:41.950
‐ He said you told them that they could
take all the bananas they want.

445
00:19:41.973 --> 00:19:42.951
‐ What? No!

446
00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:44.451
That's a mis‐puncher‐standing.

447
00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:46.578
I said one. Like this.

448
00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:47.836
‐ There's your mistake.

449
00:19:47.859 --> 00:19:49.332
That's not one. That's all.

450
00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:50.333
This means one.

451
00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:52.335
‐ Ooh! Really? This means one?

452
00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:53.920
‐ No. That means thirsty.

453
00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:54.921
This means one.

454
00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:55.505
‐ This?

455
00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:56.631
‐ No. This!

456
00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.444
‐ Oh. Thanks for clearing that up.

457
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:02.556
What are they saying now?

458
00:20:02.579 --> 00:20:04.972
‐ They feel misled.
So they're gonna take all our food.

459
00:20:04.997 --> 00:20:07.182
Right after they trash the farm
to teach you a little lesson

460
00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:08.643
in honesty and integrity.

461
00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:09.811
‐ They said all that with punches?

462
00:20:09.836 --> 00:20:11.236
‐ It's a rich, mysterious language.

463
00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:16.859
‐ So, Croods, you still want to help
with the bounceberry harvest, yes?

464
00:20:16.884 --> 00:20:18.368
‐ By stopping the punch monkeys?

465
00:20:18.393 --> 00:20:19.444
‐ And fixing your mistake?

466
00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:20.989
‐ Oh, I wouldn't put it like that.

467
00:20:21.012 --> 00:20:22.448
‐ I would. That's exactly it.

468
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:23.368
‐ We're on it.

469
00:20:23.393 --> 00:20:25.707
‐ And I'm all over it
because this is how I roll now!

470
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.579
All Dawn, no rules, so deal with it!

471
00:20:28.604 --> 00:20:29.290
‐ Same team, Dawn.

472
00:20:29.315 --> 00:20:32.000
‐ Yeah. The Kill Team!

473
00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:33.209
‐ Uh, no.

474
00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.751
No killing necessary.

475
00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:35.670
Here's the plan‐‐

476
00:20:35.693 --> 00:20:38.799
‐ No offense, but your plan
is why we need a new plan.

477
00:20:38.824 --> 00:20:40.508
‐ Right. So here's the plan.

478
00:20:40.531 --> 00:20:42.551
Hey, punch monkeys!

479
00:20:42.576 --> 00:20:44.220
You forgot the bounceberries.

480
00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:45.637
‐ So we brought you a bunch.

481
00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:46.662
‐ To go.

482
00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:51.435
Look at us, working together,
bouncing together.

483
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.646
This is a real moment.

484
00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:53.938
Whoo‐‐

485
00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:55.397
Woo‐hoo!

486
00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:56.607
Whoa!

487
00:20:56.632 --> 00:20:58.942
Boy, I am really up here.

488
00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:00.111
Oh, pretty clouds!

489
00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:01.195
That one looks like a pillow.

490
00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.405
And there's an egg, a coconut, Thunk,

491
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.907
a‐a‐and going down.

492
00:21:04.932 --> 00:21:06.159
Whoo!

493
00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:07.451
Going back up.

494
00:21:07.476 --> 00:21:09.496
Oh, yeah!

495
00:21:09.519 --> 00:21:10.809
‐ Guy.

496
00:21:11.313 --> 00:21:13.040
‐ Hey, no bounce‐frogging.

497
00:21:13.065 --> 00:21:14.855
This is serious monkey business.

498
00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:22.674
‐ It's time to chew and shoo
these monkeys outta here.

499
00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:24.409
Everyone, chew!

500
00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:28.160
And shoo!

501
00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:36.375
Abandon berries!

502
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:42.801
Gotcha!

503
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.890
Phil and Hope, you're up!

504
00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:57.376
‐ And that's how you bounce
punch monkeys out the door.

505
00:21:57.401 --> 00:22:01.213
‐ Along with all our bounceberries!

506
00:22:01.238 --> 00:22:03.948
Except for that one. Which you are eating.

507
00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:07.178
Ugh!

508
00:22:07.201 --> 00:22:09.888
‐ The point is, we did it together.

509
00:22:09.913 --> 00:22:12.900
We built a bridge between ourselves
and we crossed it.

510
00:22:12.923 --> 00:22:16.354
‐ No. The point is,
we found our purpose here.

511
00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:18.272
Fixing Phil's mistakes.

512
00:22:18.297 --> 00:22:19.566
‐ Starting with the system.

513
00:22:19.589 --> 00:22:21.984
Yeah, let's crush the system!

514
00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:24.365
‐ Ooh. And afterwards
maybe we could play Catch.

515
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.698
‐ No! They'll ruin the system.

516
00:22:26.721 --> 00:22:27.865
‐ Who cares?

517
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.868
If they're busy, I get my kitchen back.
So I win.

518
00:22:30.893 --> 00:22:32.828
Which means you win.

519
00:22:32.853 --> 00:22:35.022
‐ You're right. High five.

520
00:22:36.815 --> 00:22:38.855
‐ And we're stuck.
